# adapt-geoViewer

**geoViewer** is a *presentation component* that displays a map with a set of markers. It uses the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to render the map and the markers.

This component was inspired by [Raymond Camden's post on Leaflet and GeoJSON](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/08/23/mapping-with-leaflet).
